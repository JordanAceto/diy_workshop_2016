
Documents relating to a DIY synthesizer workshop put on in 2016 by Trevor Pinch and Jordan Aceto.

A sequence of pictures serves as a very basic "step by step" set of instructions for completing the project. With the parts in hand putting it together should be fairly straightforward. It makes a briefly entertaining, but annoying to family members and pets, buzzing noise.

Parts can be purchased at Mouser (project page contains parts for 30 kits):

The "light dependent resistor" may be purchased at smallbear electonics:

Notes/things to watch out for:
-	The stock at mouser changes over time, watch out for discontinued or out of stock parts.

-	The potentiometers have annoying metal tabs that you have to cut off. There is probably a better pot to use.

-	The speakers need wires soldered to their terminals. There may be better speakers that already have wires attached.
